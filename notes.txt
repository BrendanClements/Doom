Doom is intended to work by checking various indicators both nationally and locally
which may indicate an emergency situation.

Indicators:

Power grid - number of power outages in sample states from each grid.

Network - How many nodes are accessible in each state. IP's in each state
will be discovered and recorded for future runs.

GPS - Number of GPS/GLONASS/GALILEO/BBEIDOU satellites in range.

TODO:
Check Cell tower status.
Download NOAA satellite images.
Monitor status of local FM/AM radio stations.
Volcanoes?
